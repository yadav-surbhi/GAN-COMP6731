The aim of this project is to develop a GAN model. The datasets used are:

MNIST
CIFAR10
This project contains the following component:

Main.py
DataManager.py
Discriminator.py
Generator.py
Gan.py
report.py

To train the GAN model perform the following steps:

In terminal locate the project folder
Execute the Main.py file using command 

>> python3 Main.py


Then type in the dataset name which you like to train

>> MNIST 

or

>> CIFAR

all in capital letters

If there is no pre-trained model existed inside of Models folder, then the program will start to train a brand new model, otherwise it will pickup the training process from where it stops.
The training process will save the trained model weight after each epoch. 
It will continue the training until you manually terminate it by pressing Ctrl-c
During the training, it will create some progress images to show the current result.
All the image pictures will be located in one subfolder of folder Images which the subfolder name corresponds to the Dataset name.


To generate the report run the following command in terminal: 

>> python3 report.py

Then type in the dataset name which you like to see the current result

>> MNIST 

or

>> CIFAR

all in capital letters

The result pictures will be found inside of folder Images


After training, if you wanna to use the generator independently, you need two components below:
1. the Generator.py
2. the latest trained model weight : 
	CIFAR_generator_latest.pth or MNIST_generator_latest.pth
  they are located in folder Models

There is a segment of sample code in report.py show you how to use the trained model



Ensure the following libraries are installed to run the GAN

Pytorch
Numpy
matplotlib
